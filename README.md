# Shortest Substring

Given `s`, the length of the shortest substring containing all unique characters (within `s`) is returned.

## Choice of Language

I choose Ruby for this task because:

- It's good for rapid prototyping and development
- I know it and enjoy using it

## Dependencies

- A Ruby installation (developed and tested on `ruby 2.5.3`)
- `gem install minitest`

## Usage

```ruby
require_relative 'main.rb'

shortest_substring('bab') # => 2
```

## Tests

Run the tests with:

      $ ruby test.rb
